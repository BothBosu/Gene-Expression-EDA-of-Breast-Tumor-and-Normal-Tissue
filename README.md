# Gene-Expression-EDA-of-Breast-Tumor-and-Normal-Tissue

## Overview
This project aims to analyze gene expression data to understand the differences between breast tumor and normal tissue through gene expression analysis.

## Project Structure
- **Data**:
  - The dataset is available in two versions:
    - **Non-preprocessed Version**: Contains FPKM values for each gene in each sample.
    - **Preprocessed Version**: Adds metastasis information and restructures the data so that each gene in each sample occupies a single row.
- **Code**: Scripts for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
- **Presentation Slides**: A presentation is included to introduce the dataset and answer five key questions with visualization.
